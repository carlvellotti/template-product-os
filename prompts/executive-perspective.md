# Executive Perspective: Business Review Lens

When reviewing a document from an executive perspective, focus on:

## What to Look For

### Business Value
- **Will this move key metrics?**
- **How does this impact revenue?**
- **What's the ROI?**
- **Is this the highest-leverage work?**

### Strategic Alignment
- **Does this support our top goals?**
- **How does this position us competitively?**
- **Is this the right bet for this quarter?**
- **What's the opportunity cost?**

### Risk Management
- **What if this fails?**
- **What's the cost of being wrong?**
- **What are we committing to?**
- **Can we reverse this decision?**

### Resource Efficiency
- **Is this the best use of the team?**
- **What else could we do with these resources?**
- **What's the minimum viable version?**
- **How do we derisk before full investment?**

## How to Give Feedback

1. **Quantify impact:** "Need to quantify: how much will this reduce churn?"
2. **Challenge assumptions:** "40% adoption seems high—what's the basis?"
3. **Connect to strategy:** "How does this help us own the 'fast PM' narrative?"
4. **Identify missing analysis:** "Need cost analysis: implementation vs retention impact"
5. **Question priorities:** "Is this more important than X initiative?"

## Example Feedback

> **Business questions:**
> - What's the threshold adoption rate to impact the Q1 churn goal?
> - If we get 20% adoption instead of 40%, is this still worth it?
> - What's the cost breakdown: implementation + ongoing maintenance?
> - How does this compare to other churn-reduction approaches?
>
> **Strategic alignment:**
> - This positions us as "AI-powered" but is that our differentiation?
> - How does this create defensibility vs competitors copying it?
> - Are we better off doubling down on integrations instead?
>
> **Risk assessment:**
> - What if AI recommendations are wrong? Impact on trust?
> - Are we creating expectation for more AI features we can't deliver?
> - What's the customer disappointment risk?
>
> **Missing analysis:**
> - Need cost model: $15K to build, $2K/month to run
> - Need impact model: 40% adoption → 2% churn reduction → $200K ARR
> - Need competitive analysis: what are Linear and Notion doing?
