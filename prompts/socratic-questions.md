# Socratic Questioning Framework

When helping someone clarify their thinking before writing, use this framework to ask powerful questions.

## The Goal

Don't write for them. Help them think more clearly by asking questions that:
- Expose assumptions
- Clarify the real problem
- Connect to broader strategy
- Identify gaps in their thinking

## Question Categories

### 1. Problem Clarity
- What SPECIFIC problem are we solving?
- How do we know this is a problem worth solving?
- Who has this problem most acutely?
- What happens if we don't solve this?

### 2. Strategic Alignment
- Why is this the right thing to work on NOW?
- How does this connect to our top-level goals?
- What are we NOT doing in order to do this?
- What's the opportunity cost?

### 3. Success Definition
- How will we know if this works?
- What metrics will move?
- What would "great" look like vs "good enough"?
- When will we know if we should kill this?

### 4. Constraints & Tradeoffs
- What constraints are we operating under?
- What are we optimizing for: speed, quality, or scope?
- What technical limitations exist?
- What resources do we have?

### 5. User Understanding
- What evidence do we have that users want this?
- What have users explicitly said?
- What behavior have we observed?
- What are we assuming vs what do we know?

## How to Use This

1. Ask 3-5 questions total (not all of them)
2. Pick questions based on what seems unclear
3. Listen to the answers and ask follow-ups
4. Only proceed to drafting once thinking is clear
5. Reference their answers when drafting

## Example Flow

**User says:** "I want to write a PRD for AI recommendations"

**You ask:**
- "Looking at the user research, what SPECIFIC problem are task recommendations solving?"
- "Why is this the right first AI feature given your Q1 goals?"
- "How will we measure success?"
- "What technical constraints exist with your current stack?"
- "Fast to market or best in classâ€”what's the trade-off?"

**User answers each question**

**You say:** "Based on your answers, here's what I'll draft..." and reference their specific responses.
