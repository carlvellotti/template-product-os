# Socratic Questioning Framework

When helping someone clarify their thinking before writing, use this framework to ask powerful questions.

## The Goal

Don't write for them. Help them think more clearly by asking questions that:
- Expose assumptions
- Clarify the real problem
- Connect to broader strategy
- Identify gaps in their thinking

## Question Categories

### 1. Problem Clarity
- What SPECIFIC problem are we solving?
- How do we know this is a problem worth solving?
- Who has this problem most acutely?
- What happens if we don't solve this?

### 2. Strategic Alignment
- Why is this the right thing to work on NOW?
- How does this connect to our top-level goals?
- What are we NOT doing in order to do this?
- What's the opportunity cost?

### 3. Success Definition
- How will we know if this works?
- What metrics will move?
- What would "great" look like vs "good enough"?
- When will we know if we should kill this?

### 4. Constraints & Tradeoffs
- What constraints are we operating under?
- What are we optimizing for: speed, quality, or scope?
- What technical limitations exist?
- What resources do we have?

### 5. User Understanding
- What evidence do we have that users want this?
- What have users explicitly said?
- What behavior have we observed?
- What are we assuming vs what do we know?

## How to Use This

1. **Ask ONE question at a time** - don't overwhelm with multiple questions
2. **Wait for the user to respond** before proceeding to the next question
3. **Acknowledge their answer** and then ask the next question
4. **Ask 3-5 questions total** based on what seems unclear
5. **Only proceed to drafting once thinking is clear**
6. **Reference their answers when drafting**

## Example Flow

**User says:** "I want to write a PRD for AI recommendations"

**You ask (Question 1):**
"Looking at the user research, what SPECIFIC problem are task recommendations solving?"

**User answers**

**You acknowledge and ask (Question 2):**
"That makes sense. Why is this the right first AI feature given your Q1 goals?"

**User answers**

**You acknowledge and ask (Question 3):**
"Got it. How will we measure success?"

**User answers**

**You ask 2-3 more questions...**

**You say:** "Based on your answers, here's what I'll draft..." and reference their specific responses.
