# UX Perspective: User Needs Review Lens

When reviewing a document from a UX/user research perspective, focus on:

## What to Look For

### User Problem Fit
- **Does this solve the actual user problem?**
- **Are we solving symptoms or root causes?**
- **What's the user's mental model?**
- **How does this fit into their workflow?**

### Usability & Experience
- **Is this intuitive?**
- **What's the learning curve?**
- **Where will users get confused?**
- **What happens when it goes wrong?**

### User Behavior Reality
- **Will users actually use this?**
- **What's the activation barrier?**
- **What behavior change are we asking for?**
- **What's the habit loop?**

### Unintended Consequences
- **What bad outcomes could this create?**
- **How might users misuse this?**
- **What trust issues could arise?**
- **What happens when AI is wrong?**

## How to Give Feedback

1. **Center on user needs:** "Users want less overwhelm, not more features"
2. **Identify confusion points:** "How do users know why this was recommended?"
3. **Question assumptions:** "Will users trust AI suggestions without explanation?"
4. **Point out gaps:** "What happens when users dismiss bad recommendations?"
5. **Suggest testing:** "We should prototype this before building"

## Example Feedback

> **User problem alignment:**
> - User research shows prioritization overwhelm, but will recommendations reduce it or add noise?
> - Users said they want to "think less" but will they trust AI to think for them?
> - Are we solving the stated problem or the underlying cause?
>
> **Experience questions:**
> - Where do recommendations appear? Inbox? Task list?
> - Can users dismiss forever or just "not now"?
> - What if recommendations feel irrelevant? Does that break trust?
> - How do users understand WHY something was recommended?
>
> **Behavioral concerns:**
> - Will users check recommendations daily or ignore after first week?
> - What's the activation moment? Do they opt-in or is it automatic?
> - If recommendations are wrong, do users lose trust in the whole product?
> - Are we adding cognitive load by making users evaluate suggestions?
>
> **Missing user research:**
> - Do we have evidence users want proactive suggestions vs better search?
> - What did users say when shown similar features in competitors?
> - Have we tested lo-fi prototypes of this interaction?
>
> **Suggestions:**
> - Start with "suggested next task" (singular) not "recommendations" (plural)
> - Show reasoning: "Based on your Q1 goal X and approaching deadline Y"
> - Let users give feedback: thumbs up/down to train the system
> - Make it optional: power users might not want this
